Minimal Chat Application
========================

A simple messaging Application that leaves out complex features that these modern day applications impose upon us, to escape from this we decided to build an application featuring group conversations and file sharing.

## Roles Involved:
* Admin
* Member

## What are our features:
- If a user enters a group-name which does not exist, a new group is created with the user as an admin.
- If user enters a group-name which already exists, he is added to the group if admin approves his request.
- Send and receive messages.
- File transfer.

### For better experience, GUI is added.
